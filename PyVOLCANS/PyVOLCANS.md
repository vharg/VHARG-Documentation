# Defining analogues according to the Tierz et al., 2019 PyVOLCANS method

## Introduction

The PyVOLCANS code (https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans) can be implemented easily through anaconda following the below steps:

1. Download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Open Anaconda Prompt and type: pip install pyvolcans
3. Then it should be good to go, get the first ten analogues by typing pyvolcans VolcanoName, e.g. pyvolcans Taal
4. To see pyvolcans options, e.g. to see more analogues or to change the weighting of the underlying data, type: pyvolcans --help

And that's it!
